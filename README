# Escoria Rewrite

Libre framework for the creation of point-and-click adventure games with
the MIT-licensed multi-platform game engine [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org).

This repository is big rewrite of the original Escoria framework (see https://github.com/godotengine/escoria/tree/master).
Its purpose is to make Escoria work as a plugin for Godot Engine editor, instead of being a collection of scripts and scenes.
It is intended to be easier to use and easier to maintain. It is designed so that you can claim it for yourself and modify it to match
the needs of your specific game and team.

Escoria should always be compatible with the current stable version of Godot Engine, and you should use
If you're encountering issues or incompatibilities, please raise an issue on [Escoria's Github repository](https://github.com/godotengine/escoria/issues).
